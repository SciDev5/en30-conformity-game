# Dangers of Conformity Game

A game I made for my English class final project.

## How to play:

Run the game by running `cargo run` in the terminal.

Controls:
- To go to the next line of dialogue, press enter.
- To speak to the characters, type a number in when prompted
to select from a list of responses.

Have fun!

## Artist's Statement
Thesis: **Unconditional conformity is deeply dangerous, particularly to the
people who don't fit in to society's predefined boxes, who can be
driven to the brink of death due to the pressure on them to fit in.**

In the game, you play the role of a therapist. This makes it more
natural to unpack the experiences and pent up emotions of the
characters from an outside

perspective. Furthermore, it allows the unpacking of all they have
experienced after nearly everything has happened in the story in
order to convey how much mental damage the characters accumulated
without freedom to act as they want. Additionally, the inclusion
of the dialogue before each question allows the game to flow and
reference and analyze events in both stories by calling up and
prompting the character's memories. In order to beat the game, the
player has to select true information from the stories and life
that supports the thesis and aids the characters in recovery.

Edna's branch of the game is driven by the question posed in class:
"What would a good ending for Edna look like". My solution is to
move her to modern times, and aid her in properly using her
freedom, because it's clear she needs herself freedom. Neil's 
branch of the game is focused on helping him stand up to his father.
This was achieved in the game by building off the work of Keeting,
referring to when he told him his facade for his father is like
acting (Weir).
